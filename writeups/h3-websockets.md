# Shepherd Writeup for draft-ietf-httpbis-h3-websockets

## 1. Summary

Mark Nottingham is the document shepherd; Francesca Palombini is the responsible Area Director.

The mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol over a single stream of an HTTP/2 connection is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but the HTTP version-specific details need to be specified. This document describes how the mechanism is adapted for HTTP/3.

This document is being requested for publication as a Proposed Standard.


## 2. Review and Consensus

Because it is both small and extending already established functionality from HTTP/2 to HTTP/3, this document has enjoyed brief but thorough review by the HTTP WG. Its progress has been uncontroversial, and considered an obvious but necessary step by all that have weighed in.


## 3. Intellectual Property

The author has confirmed that they have stated that their direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document has already been disclosed, in conformance with BCPs 78 and 79.


## 4. Other Points

There are no downrefs in this document, and the IANA Considerations appear to be correct.

The acknowledgements section is empty and can be removed in a subsequent draft, or by the RFC Editor.
