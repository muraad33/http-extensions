# Introduction

Structured Field Values for HTTP {{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}} introduced a data model with associated parsing and serialization algorithms for use by new HTTP field values. Header fields that are defined as Structured Fields can realise a number of benefits, including:

* Improved interoperability and security: precisely defined parsing and serialisation algorithms are typically not available for fields defined with just ABNF and/or prose.
* Reuse of common implementations: many parsers for other fields are specific to a single field or a small family of fields
* Canonical form: because a deterministic serialisation algorithm is defined for each type, Structure Fields have a canonical representation
* Enhanced API support: a regular data model makes it easier to expose field values as a native data structure in implementations
* Alternative serialisations: While {{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}} defines a textual serialisation of that data model, other, more efficient serialisations of the underlying data model are also possible.

However, a field needs to be defined as a Structured Field for these benefits to be realised. Many existing fields are not, making up the bulk of header and trailer fields seen in HTTP traffic on the internet.

This specification defines how a selection of existing HTTP fields can be handled as Structured Fields, so that these benefits can be realised -- thereby making them Retrofit Structured Fields.

It does so using two techniques. {{compatible}} lists compatible fields -- those that can be handled as if they were Structured Fields due to the similarity of their defined syntax to that in Structured Fields. {{mapped}} lists mapped fields -- those whose syntax needs to be transformed into an underlying data model which is then mapped into that defined by Structured Fields.

While implementations can parse and serialise compatible fields as Structured Fields subject to the caveats in {{compatible}}, a sender cannot generate mapped fields from {{mapped}} and expect them to be understood and acted upon by the recipient without prior negotiation. This specification does not define such a mechanism.

# Compatible Fields {#compatible}

The HTTP fields listed in {{compatible-fields}} can usually have their values handled as Structured Fields according to the listed parsing and serialisation algorithms in {{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}, subject to the listed caveats.

The listed types are chosen for compatibility with the defined syntax of the field as well as with actual internet traffic. However, not all instances of these fields will successfully parse. This might be because the field value is clearly invalid, or it might be because it is valid but not parseable as a Structured Field.

An application using this specification will need to consider how to handle such field values. Depending on its requirements, it might be advisable to reject such values, treat them as opaque strings, or attempt to recover a structured value from them in an ad hoc fashion.

{:id="compatible-fields"}

Note the following caveats:

Parameter names:
: HTTP parameter names are case-insensitive (per {{Section 5.6.6 of HTTP}}), but Structured Fields require them to be all-lowercase. Although the vast majority of parameters seen in typical traffic are all-lowercase, compatibility can be improved by force-lowercasing parameters when encountered.

Empty Field Values:
: Empty and whitespace-only field values are considered errors in Structured Fields. For compatible fields, an empty field indicates that the field should be silently ignored.

Alt-Svc:
: Some ALPN tokens (e.g., `h3-Q43`) do not conform to key's syntax. Since the final version of HTTP/3 uses the `h3` token, this shouldn't be a long-term issue, although future tokens may again violate this assumption.

Cache-Control, Expect-CT, Pragma, Prefer, Preference-Applied, and Surrogate-Control:
: These Dictionary-based fields consider the key to be case-insensitive, but Structured Fields requires keys to be all-lowercase. Although the vast majority of values seen in typical traffic are all-lowercase, compatibility can be improved by force-lowercasing these Dictionary keys when encountered.

Content-Length:
: Content-Length is defined as a List because it is not uncommon for implementations to mistakenly send multiple values. See {{Section 8.6 of HTTP}} for handling requirements.

Retry-After:
: Only the delta-seconds form of Retry-After is supported; a Retry-After value containing a http-date will need to be either converted into delta-seconds or represented as a raw value.


# Mapped Fields {#mapped}

Some HTTP fields can have their values represented in Structured Fields by mapping them into its data types and then serialising the result using an alternative field name.

For example, the Date HTTP header field carries a string representing a date:

~~~ http-message
Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT
~~~

Its value is more efficiently represented as an integer number of delta seconds from the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, minus leap seconds). Thus, the example above would be mapped as:

~~~ http-message
SF-Date: 784072177
~~~

As in {{compatible}}, these fields are unable to represent values that are not parseable, and so an application using this specification will need to how to support such values. Typically, handling them using the original field name is sufficient.

Each field name listed below indicates a replacement field name and a means of mapping its original value into a Structured Field.


## URLs

The field names in {{url-fields}} (paired with their mapped field names) have values that can be represented as Structured Fields by considering the original field's value as a string.

| Field Name       | Mapped Field Name   |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Content-Location | SF-Content-Location |
| Location         | SF-Location         |
| Referer          | SF-Referer          |
{:id="url-fields"}

For example, a Location field could be represented as:

~~~ http-message
SF-Location: "https://example.com/foo"
~~~


## Dates

The field names in {{date-fields}} (paired with their mapped field names) have values that can be represented as Structured Fields by parsing their payload according to {{Section 5.6.7 of HTTP}} and representing the result as an integer number of seconds delta from the Unix Epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, minus leap seconds).

| Field Name          | Mapped Field Name   |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Date                | SF-Date             |
| Expires             | SF-Expires          |
| If-Modified-Since   | SF-IMS              |
| If-Unmodified-Since | SF-IUS              |
| Last-Modified       | SF-LM               |
{:id="date-fields"}

For example, an Expires field could be represented as:

~~~ http-message
SF-Expires: 1571965240
~~~

## ETags

The field value of the ETag header field can be represented as a String Structured Field by representing the entity-tag as a string, and the weakness flag as a boolean "w" parameter on it, where true indicates that the entity-tag is weak; if 0 or unset, the entity-tag is strong.

For example:

~~~ http-message
SF-ETag: "abcdef"; w=?1
~~~

If-None-Match's field value can be represented as SF-INM, which is a List of the structure described above.

For example:

~~~ http-message
SF-INM: "abcdef"; w=?1, "ghijkl"
~~~


## Links

The field value of the Link header field {{!RFC8288}} can be represented in the SF-Link List Structured Field by representing the URI-Reference as a string, and link-param as parameters.

For example:

~~~ http-message
SF-Link: "/terms"; rel="copyright"; anchor="#foo"
~~~


## Cookies

The field values of the Cookie and Set-Cookie fields {{!RFC6265}} can be represented in the SF-Cookie Structured Field (a List) and SF-Set-Cookie Structured Field (a Dictionary), respectively.

In each case, cookie names are serialized as tokens, whereas their values are serialised as Strings, unless they can be represented accurately and unambiguously using the textual representation of another structured types (e.g., an Integer or Decimal).

Set-Cookie parameters map to parameters on the appropriate SF-Set-Cookie member, with the parameter name being forced to lowercase. Set-Cookie parameter values are Strings unless a specific type is defined. This specification defines the parameter types in {{cookie-params}}.

| Parameter Name      | Structured Type     |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Max-Age             | Integer             |
| Secure              | Boolean             |
| HttpOnly            | Boolean             |
| SameSite            | Token               |
{:id="cookie-params"}

Note that cookies in both fields are separated by commas, not semicolons, and multiple cookies can appear in each field.

For example:

~~~ http-message
SF-Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; expires="Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT";
               samesite=Strict
SF-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42, lang=en-US
~~~


# IANA Considerations

Please add the following note to the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry":

> The "Structured Type" column indicates the type of the field (per RFC8941), if any, and may be "Dictionary", "List" or "Item". A prefix of "*" indicates that it is a retrofit type (i.e., not natively Structured); see \[this specification].

Then, add a new column, "Structured Type", with the values from {{compatible}} assigned to the nominated registrations, prefixing each with "*" to indicate that it is a retrofit type.

Then, add the field names in {{new-fields}}, with the corresponding Structured Type as indicated, a status of "permanent" and referring to this document.

| Field Name          | Structured Type |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| SF-Content-Location | String          |
| SF-Location         | String          |
| SF-Referer          | String          |
| SF-Date             | Item            |
| SF-Expires          | Item            |
| SF-IMS              | Item            |
| SF-IUS              | Item            |
| SF-LM               | Item            |
| SF-ETag             | Item            |
| SF-INM              | List            |
| SF-Link             | List            |
| SF-Set-Cookie       | Dictionary      |
| SF-Cookie           | List            |
{:id="new-fields"}


# Security Considerations

{{compatible}} identifies existing HTTP fields that can be parsed and serialised with the algorithms defined in {{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}. Variances from other implementations might be exploitable, particularly if they allow an attacker to target one implementation in a chain (e.g., an intermediary). However, given the considerable variance in parsers already deployed, convergence towards a single parsing algorithm is likely to have a net security benefit in the longer term.

{{mapped}} defines alternative representations of existing fields. Because downstream consumers might interpret the message differently based upon whether they recognise the alternative representation, implementations are prohibited from generating such fields unless they have negotiated support for them with their peer. This specification does not define such a mechanism, but any such definition needs to consider the implications of doing so carefully.
